# Oliveira, I.F., Baccaro, F.B., Werneck, F.P., Haugaasen, T. Seasonal flooding decreases fruit-feeding butterfly species dominance and increases spatial turnover in floodplain forests of central Amazonia. Submitted to Ecology and Evolution (2022).

# Basically, we had three hypothesis, and for each one we made one analysis.
# In the first hypothesis, we explored the richness and abundance of butterfly communities across flooding seasons in three forest types (terra firme, várzea and igapó). We ran different types of rarefaction curves, using different metrics, like richness (qD=0), diversity (qD=1 and qD=2), completeness, and sample-based. 

#The second hypotheses, we explored the compositional change of butterfly community in the three forest types across seasons and strata.
#For this, we ran a PERMANOVA in each forest type separetly.

#In the third hypothesis we wanted to assess the butterfly beta-diversity components (turnover and nestedness) across seasons and strata. 
#We ran the Legendre's function (2014) with abundance data and we also ran a bootstrap to test the beta-diversity components values between seasons and strata.
